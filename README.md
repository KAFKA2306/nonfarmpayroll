# 📊 US Employment Statistics Dashboard

**Live Dashboard**: https://kafka2306.github.io/nonfarmpayroll/

Fully automated system for analyzing US Nonfarm Payroll Employment data with monthly updates, revision tracking, and uncertainty quantification.

## 🎯 What This Does

- **Collects Real Data**: Downloads latest employment statistics from FRED API every month
- **Analyzes Revisions**: Tracks how initial job reports get revised over time
- **Quantifies Uncertainty**: Shows that employment numbers have ±112K error range (not just ±85K published)
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Professional web interface with charts, tables, export features
- **Fully Automated**: Updates itself every month on employment release day (first Friday)

## 📊 Key Insights

### Employment Data Reliability
- **BLS Published Error**: ±85,000 jobs (statistical sampling error)
- **Historical Revision Error**: ±73,400 jobs (based on actual revision patterns)

## 📅 How Automation Works

### Monthly Updates (Automatic)
```yaml
Schedule: First Friday of each month at 10:30 AM EST
Process: 
  1. Download latest FRED employment data
  2. Calculate revision statistics and uncertainty
  3. Update all dashboard charts and tables
  4. Deploy to GitHub Pages
  5. Generate success/failure report
```

### Daily Health Checks (Automatic)
```yaml
Schedule: Every day at 12:00 PM UTC
Process:
  1. Check if dashboard is accessible (HTTP 200)
  2. Verify data is fresh (less than 40 days old)
  3. Auto-trigger update if data is stale
  4. Generate health status report
```

### Manual Controls (As Needed)
- **Force Update**: Actions → "Update Employment Statistics Dashboard"
- **Deploy UI Changes**: Actions → "Deploy Static Dashboard"  
- **Health Check**: Actions → "Dashboard Health Check"

## 📊 Understanding the Data

### Employment Numbers
- **Final**: Official employment level after all revisions (thousands of people)
- **Release 1**: Initial monthly announcement
- **Revision**: Difference between final and initial (positive = underestimated)
- **Uncertainty**: ±90% confidence interval around estimates

### Revision Patterns
- **Positive Revisions**: Initial estimates were too low (employment higher)
- **Negative Revisions**: Initial estimates were too high (employment lower)
- **Large Revisions**: Changes >100K that significantly impact markets
- **Crisis Periods**: 2008 financial crisis, 2020 pandemic show higher volatility

### Quality Metrics
- **Data Completeness**: Percentage of records with all fields
- **Consistency**: Accuracy of revision calculations
- **Outlier Detection**: Automatic flagging of unusual periods
- **Health Score**: Overall system reliability (0-100)

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Data Sources
- **FRED PAYEMS**: Federal Reserve Economic Data (official US government)
- **Processing**: Python scripts with pandas/numpy for statistical analysis
- **Storage**: CSV files for data, JSON for metadata
